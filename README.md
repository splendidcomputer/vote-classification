# Vote Classification using Machine Learning to Categorize Ballots

This is a Jupyter notebook that uses Python to perform machine learning classification on a dataset of political votes. The notebook demonstrates the use of two classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression, to make predictions on the test set. The notebook also computes the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores for both classifiers.

## Requirements
This notebook requires the following Python modules:

* pandas
* scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook is a CSV file named vote_csv.csv which contains data on votes made by US Congressmen on various issues. The dataset has the following attributes:

*Party: the political party of the Congressman
*Handicapped-Infants: voted for or against the handicapped infants bill
*Water-Project-Cost-Sharing: voted for or against the water project cost sharing bill
*Adoption-of-the-Budget-Resolution: voted for or against the adoption of the budget resolution
*Physician-Fee-Freeze: voted for or against the physician fee freeze bill
*El-Salvador-Aid: voted for or against the El Salvador aid bill
*Religious-Groups-In-Schools: voted for or against the religious groups in schools bill
*Anti-Satellite-Test-Ban: voted for or against the anti-satellite test ban bill
*Aid-to-Nicaraguan-Contras: voted for or against the aid to Nicaraguan contras bill
*Mx-Missile: voted for or against the MX missile bill
*Immigration: voted for or against the immigration bill
*Synfuels-Corporation-Cutback: voted for or against the synfuels corporation cutback bill
*Education-Spending: voted for or against the education spending bill
*Superfund-Right-to-Sue: voted for or against the superfund right to sue bill
*Crime: voted for or against the crime bill
*Duty-Free-Exports: voted for or against the duty-free exports bill
*Export-South-Africa: voted for or against the export to South Africa bill

## Usage

To run the notebook, open the file `Vote_classification_using_machine_learning_to_categorize_ballots.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

## Results
The notebook outputs the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores for both classifiers. The results can be found in the notebook under the relevant code cells.
